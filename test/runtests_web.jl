# notes on testing:
# The submodules "DataFormats," "SEED," and "Quake" are almost completely reliant
# on the (non-existent) sample files, so they have been removed from the suite of
# tests performed. The submodule "Web" has also been removed as it is failing both
# due to dependence on the sample files and unsuccesful web resquests. For the other
# submodules, only a portion of the tests actually rely on the sample files. In
# such cases, I've commented out only the lines within the test files that require
# the sample files, so that the rest of the useful tests can be performed. A few
# specific files (in the variable "skip_files" below) are also dependent on the
# sample files, so we skip them in testing via the "if" statement at line 70.
# Overall, this is a bit complicated since multiple methods have been used to
# eliminate certain tests, but one should be able to begin the process of replacing
# the test files (if they so choose) by cloning a version of the SeisBase repo
# from before August 2023, running the tests, and addressing the errors one-by-one as
# they arise (which is how we ended up here- just replace the sample files and values used
# to test them instead of simply commenting out the offending lines as I did.) Good luck!
