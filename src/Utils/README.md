# Utils
Utility functions for SeisIO that depend on custom Types.

## Expected Code Coverage
100% of new/changed lines

## File Naming
1. Don't add file names that already exist in other directories. To prevent
such conflicts, rename each `($fname).(ext)` to `($fname)_utils.(ext)`.
2. Tests for file `($fname).(ext)` belong in `test/Utils/test_($fname).(ext)`
